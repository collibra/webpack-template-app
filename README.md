# webpack-template-app

A minimal, development-focussed template to get you up and running with Webpack, Babel & LESS.

- Makes ES6 "just work"
- Compiles and includes your LESS files
- Serves your files
- Automatically recompiles/reloads your page when JavaScript/LESS files change
- Decide where your files go (to a degree)
